# ODK-SpriteLib

A library for DarkEden sprite format.

This was made with just learning in mind. No profit or copyright infringement intended.


I'm making this code public for those looking to study it.
It's likely that I won't continue developing it, but who knows?


* Supports: .spk, .ispk, .sspk, .aspk
* BMP, PNG, TIFF -> Any sprite type
* Any sprite type -> BMP, PNG, TIFF


Converting from image to .aspk isn't quite right yet.
